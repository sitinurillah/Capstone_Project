# Data Science Capstone-Data Product
## Capstone Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. The server.R, predict.R and ui.R files are the shiny application. The application has been deployed [here](https://sitinurillah.shinyapps.io/CapstonePredictiveTextModel/).

The second part of the assignment was to create a *Reproducible* Pitch Presentation for the app. This was to be a html5 slide deck using either Slidify or Rstudio Presenter. The slides presentation using Rstudio Presenter [here](http://rpubs.com/nurillah/Capstone_Predictive_Text_Model).
